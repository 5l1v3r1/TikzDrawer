# TikzDrawer
This is a tool to easily draw tikz diagrams without needing to write code. A live version of this repo is hosted using [Github Pages](https://rickdejager.github.io/TikzDrawer/).  
  
I made this tool mainly to learn Javascript and p5js and I still have some features I'd like to implement like directed edges, color support and various UX improvements.
